## Context and Approach

### Architecture and Technology Choices

#### Frontend

- **React with Vite:** We chose React for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI components and efficient rendering. Vite was selected as the build tool for its fast development server and optimized build process, which improves development speed and production performance.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling without writing custom CSS.


#### Backend

- **Express with Node.js:** Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. Node.js allows us to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, which is crucial for processing and serving Git commit data quickly.


#### Git Diff Rendering

- The application replicates the git diff page's functionality. This includes fetching the commit data and rendering the diff exactly as it appears in Git, ensuring familiarity and ease of use for developers.

### Intentional Deviations

- We opted to use a standard Git library to get JSON responses for diffs and internal gif-diff package to obtain diff fetails. This decision was made to maintain control over the data format and processing logic, allowing for a more tailored and optimized solution.

## Known Limitations and Trade-offs

### Scalability

- **Limitation:** The current implementation is designed to handle a moderate amount of traffic. It may face performance issues under heavy load or with very large repositories.
- **Trade-off:** We prioritized rapid development and ease of deployment over scalability. This allows for quicker iterations and faster feedback during the initial development stages.

### Error Handling

- **Limitation:** Basic error handling is implemented. Other ivalid routes are also handled to redirect user back to valid diff page with ease of access.
- **Trade-off:** Focusing on the core functionality first was crucial. Enhanced error handling can be added as the application matures and we gather more insights into common failure modes.

### Rate Limiting
- **Trade-off:** Since we have opted to use GITHUB API, we may face issue with their rate limiting imposed by GITHUB.

### Authentication and Security

- **Limitation:** The current version lacks robust authentication mechanisms and advanced security features.
- **Trade-off:** Initial development efforts were concentrated on functionality. Security features, including OAuth integration and rate limiting, are planned for future iterations.

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Improvements

- **What:** Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling strategies.
- **How:** Utilize containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) to manage multiple instances of the application.
- **Why:** To handle increased traffic and ensure high availability and reliability.

### Enhanced Error Handling

- **What:** Introduce comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms.
- **How:** Use middleware in Express to catch and log errors, and implement user-friendly error messages on the frontend.
- **Why:** To improve the robustness of the application and provide clearer feedback to users.

### Authentication and Security

- **What:** Integrate OAuth for authentication and implement rate limiting.
- **How:** Use libraries like Passport.js for OAuth integration and middleware like express-rate-limit for rate limiting.
- **Why:** To protect the application from unauthorized access and abuse, ensuring data integrity and security.

### Performance Optimization

- **What:** Optimize backend processing and frontend rendering.
- **How:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis), and use memoization techniques in React components.
- **Why:** To reduce latency and improve the user experience, especially when dealing with large diffs.

### User Interface Enhancements

- **What:** Improve the UI with additional features such as search, filtering, and better diff visualization.
- **How:** Utilize React component libraries (e.g., Material-UI) and enhance the styling and functionality of the diff viewer.
- **Why:** To provide a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for users to navigate and analyze diffs.
